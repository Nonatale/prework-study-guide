# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Introduction to Web Development (HTMl, CSS, Javascript, Git)

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

In order to develop my skills to pursue my career in programming, I created this webpage based on the prework program from the Columbia Bootcamp program. This webpage is an introduction to HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.
